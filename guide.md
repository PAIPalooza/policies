### Judging üèÖ
Startup Weekends are judged based on a set of criteria that evaluates various aspects of the teams' projects.

Judging at Startup Weekends is usually done by a panel of judges who come from diverse backgrounds, including entrepreneurs, investors, industry experts, and academics. They bring different perspectives to the evaluation process, ensuring a well-rounded assessment of each team's project. The goal is to identify teams that have the potential to develop their ideas into successful, scalable businesses.

#### 1. Validation:
- **Customer Validation**: Did the team validate their idea by talking to real users, customers, or experts? This involves demonstrating that there is a real demand for the product or service.
- **Market Research**: Has the team conducted thorough research on their market and potential competitors?

#### 2. Execution and Design:
- **Prototype**: How functional and developed is the prototype? Judges look for a working demo that shows the product's core features.

#### 3. Business Model:
- **Revenue Model**: Does the team have a clear and viable plan for generating revenue? This includes understanding the target market, pricing strategy, and sales channels.
- **Scalability**: Can the business model scale effectively? Judges assess whether the idea has the potential to grow and serve a larger market.

### Judging Criteria:

#### 1. Customer Validation:
- **Interviews and Surveys**: Evidence of interviews, surveys, or other forms of direct engagement with potential customers.

- **Technical Implementation**: Quality of the technical implementation. This includes code quality, use of technology, and overall functionality.
- **Design and UX**: Quality of the design and user interface. Judges look for a product that is easy to use and visually appealing.

#### 3. Business Model:
