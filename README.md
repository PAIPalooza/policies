### 🔥 Build with AI. Code by Vibes.

Are you a non-technical founder looking to break through technical blockers? Or a developer ready to ship 10x faster with AI?

This **5-hour high-intensity AI hack sprint** is powered by the **Semantic Seed Coding Standard (SSCS)** — a TDD/BDD-based AI prompting framework. Teams will go from idea to deployable MVP with the help of GPT-4, Claude, and expert mentors.

#### 💡 What You’ll Do:
- Attend a **1-hour Vibe Coding Workshop**
- Build a working MVP in just 4 hours with your AI pair
- Use LLMs like co-founders, not tools
- Collaborate IRL with technical + non-technical teams
- Pitch live and win powerful AI tools + startup support
