### 🔥 About the Kickoff Hackathon

Are you a non-technical founder ready to break through technical barriers? Or a dev team using AI to 10x your velocity?

Join us for a **5-hour high-intensity AI build sprint** powered by the **Semantic Seed Coding Standard (SSCS)** — a TDD/BDD-based prompt engineering system we’ve used to boost code output by 40–60%.

### 💡 What’s Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is a mindset. It’s pairing with your AI like it’s your co-founder, not just your assistant. You’ll learn how to:

- 🔧 Structure ideas into tested, production-ready code  
- 🤖 Use GPT-4 or Claude with real-time prompting  
- 🚀 Build MVPs using SSCS and AI-assisted workflows  
- 🎯 Ship in hours — not weeks
